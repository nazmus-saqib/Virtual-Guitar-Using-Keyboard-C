# KeyBoard based Guitar

### This was my first undergraduate project done under Ishtiaque Hossain Sir.

- In this project i tried to make a simple keyboard based guitar using C. For this I used > winmm
library to load the audio files in Codeblocks library as it was not there by default and used gnu/gcc compiler to compile.

- First I recorded down and up stroke for all 7 major and minor chords then assigned each stroke to a particular key. When someone try to play guitar he or she just has to press the keys accordingly.
